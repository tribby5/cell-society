NetID: mra21

To work on this exercise, create a branch in your team's repository called duplicated_NETIDs, where NETIDs is your pair's Duke NetIDs. As a pair, you will refactor some duplicated code and describe your decision making process in a separate file, called DISCUSSION.md, using Gitlab's markdown format.

We looked at my duplicated code and, though there were portions that we could consolidate, a lot of it is code that has already been removed and refactored in our newest version. In one specific example, we saw duplicated code in our methods to generate neighbors. In the newer versions of the project this will be fixed because there will be an overhaul of how neighbors are generated and then given to the class that decides what do to with the current neighbors.

My partner left before I could get his netID but he has mine in his discussion markdown file.
