#####Names of Group Members: Matthew Tribby (mrt28), Miguel Anderson (mra21), Andres Lebbos (afl13)

#####Date Started:
1. Planning Started: January 26th, 2017
2. Coding Started: January 30th, 2017

######Estimated Total Hours:
145
######Group Members' Roles:
1. Matthew Tribby: Main Task: Front-end. Created the user-interface and integrated that with the XML reader and the back-end. 
2. Miguel Anderson: Main Task: Back-end. Major coder of the simulations and for building the structure of the cells and their integration into a drawable grid.
3. Andres Lebbos: Main Task: XML Reader. Created the setup for the XML Reader to take in files and convert that to executable simulations. Also a major help on the back-end in terms of organization of cells and helping to structure the drawable grid.

#####Resources Used:
Stack Overflow
#####Files used to start project:
Main which is located inside the cellsociety_team13 package is need to run the program.
#####Files used to test the project:
All the XML files we used to test our programs can be found in the data folder of the project.
#####Data or resource files needed by the project:
1. Data: Need an XML in a specific format with examples that can be viewed in the data folder of this project. An XML file is needed to execute a simulation.
2. Resource files: a resource package is needed to display text on the user interface. In the resources package there is an example called Enlgish.properties which is used in all parts of
the user interface in this project. A resource file can easily be switched out if desired.

#####Any information about using the program:
An XML file properly formatted is needed to run the program. Once inside the simulation, the user can do several things to dynamically affect the output. The user can play, pause, step through, reset, and change the speed of the current simulation. The user can also switch out the XML file for a new one to change the simulation. Additionally, the user can add another simulation and place it side by side with the current simulation and choose to play them either independently or together. Additionally, for certain simulations, the user can change the value of parameters which affect the outcome of the simulation.
